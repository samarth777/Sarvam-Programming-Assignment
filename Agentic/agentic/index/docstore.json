A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced fr om its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a for ce on the adjacent\nparticle. As a r esult of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced fr om its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This pr ocess continues in the\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in tur n produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forwar d themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forwar d. This is what\nhappens during pr opagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwar ds,\nit creates a r egion of low pr essur e called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\nthe air . These make the sound wave thatFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork dipped in water\nFrom the above activities what do you\nconclude? Can you pr oduce sound without\na vibrating object?\nIn the above activities we have pr oduced\nsound by striking the tuning fork. W e can\nalso pr oduce sound by plucking, scratching,\nrubbing, blowing or shaking dif ferent objects.\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\nthe objects? W e set the objects vibrating and\nproduce sound. V ibration means a kind of\nrapid to and fr o motion of an object. The\nsound of the human voice is pr oduced due\nto vibrations in the vocal cor ds. When a bir d\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\nis produced. A str etched rubber band when\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\nthe vibration of the str etched rubber band.\nActivity _____________ 11.3\n\u2022Make a list of different types of\nmusical instruments and discuss\nwith your friends which part of the\ninstrument vibrates to produce\nsound.\n11.2Propagation of Sound\nSound is pr oduced by vibrating objects. The\nmatter or substance thr ough which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves thr ough a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener . When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium ar ound it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way fromFig. 11.4: A vibrating object creating a series of\ncompr essions (C) and rar efactions (R) in\nthe medium.\nRationalised 2023-24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3212, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e73cdaa0-ec52-4d2b-8168-e996585c2269": {"__data__": {"id_": "e73cdaa0-ec52-4d2b-8168-e996585c2269", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5abd9d5-170e-4107-b9c7-f1963cdb9634", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "hash": "63e9e10bae976182cfe8a71c5dd5323dc5f182a8c51a81449a61533b85c3a70f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SOUND 129propagates through the medium.\nCompr ession is the r egion of high pr essur e\nand rar efaction is the r egion of low pr essur e.\nPressur e is related to the number of particles\nof a medium in a given volume.

Y ou hold the other end.\nNow str etch the slinky as shown in\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\ntowards your friend.\n\u2022What do you notice? If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n\u2022If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.The regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density\u2014 it is not a mechanical\nwave.

The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure.

The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure.\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\n\u03bd (Greek letter , nu). Its SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\nother words, we can say that the time taken\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\nFrequency and time period are related as\nfollows:\n A violin and a flute may both be played at\nthe same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source. But the sounds we receive are\ndifferent. This is due to the different\ncharacteristics associated with the sound.\nPitch is one of the characteristics.=1vTFig. 11.7:  Low pitch sound has low frequency and\nhigh pitch of sound has high frequency.\nFig. 11.8: Soft sound has small amplitude and\nlouder sound has large amplitude.\nRationalised 2023-24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd865a90-0ce8-4fe4-837a-9a847472c2b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd865a90-0ce8-4fe4-837a-9a847472c2b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00408e29-a49b-4cfb-abfd-706d88d46a66", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "hash": "d3558910ad98cc0f2a103a287c2fff5ef6f60d9ed4f3cb5afe1102ec1759788f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SCIENCE 132QQuestions\n1.Which wave property determines\n(a) loudness, (b) pitch?\n2.Guess which sound has a higher\npitch: guitar or car horn?\nThe speed of sound is defined as the\ndistance which a point on a wave, such as a\ncompression or a rarefaction, travels per unit\ntime.\nWe know,\nspeed, v = distance / time\n= \u03bb\nTExample 11.1 A sound wave has a\nfrequency of 2 kHz and wave length\n35 cm.

Loudness is a\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\nsimply because our ear detects it better .of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\nit is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8\nshows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft\nsound of the same frequency.\nThe quality or timber of sound is that\ncharacteristic which enables us to distinguish\none sound from another having the same pitch\nand loudness.

The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium thr ough which it travels. Y ou will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s\u20131 at 0 \u00baC and 344 m s\u20131 at 22 \u00baC. The speeds\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\nmedia ar e listed in T able 11.1.

This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperatur e, say at 22 \u00baC in air , the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) \u00d7 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m.

The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2  A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s\u20131?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s\u20131\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v \u00d7 t = 346 m s\u20131 \u00d7 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson.

Children under the age of\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\ndolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain\nfamilies have very sensitive hearing equipment.\nThese moths can hear the high frequencyQ\nFig.11.11:  Stethoscope\n3.Generally the ceilings of concert halls,\nconference halls and cinema halls are\ncurved so that sound after reflection\nreaches all corners of the hall, as\nshown in Fig 1 1.12. Sometimes a\ncurved soundboard may be placed\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\nspreads evenly across the width of the\nhall (Fig 1 1.13).In these instruments, a tube followed\nby a conical opening reflects sound\nsuccessively to guide most of the\nsound waves from the source in the\nforward direction towards the\naudience.\nRationalised 2023-24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d90f035-587f-4bce-ab2f-50f6ccb3b18f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d90f035-587f-4bce-ab2f-50f6ccb3b18f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02a70a0e-6bea-4012-8d2b-6c664b2a54dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "iesc111.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/samarth/Documents/Samarth/Sarvam-Programming-Assignment/Agentic/agentic/data/iesc111.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1577537, "creation_date": "2024-09-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-17"}, "hash": "50e6864f56275953f056d47cd346f661da1658c98270217b37f47228c05eb225", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SCIENCE 136squeaks of the bat and know when a bat\nis flying nearby, and are able to escape\ncapture.
